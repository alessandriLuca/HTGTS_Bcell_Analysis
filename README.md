# HTGTS_Bcell_Analysis
Source code for genomic event analysis tools (GEAT) developed in our laboratory to perform the analysis is available at https://github.com/geatools/geat
The tools can be initialized through platform-specific scripts: script.cmd for Windows and script.sh for Linux/OS X. Executing these scripts launches a Docker container that is accessible via localhost:8888. This process automatically initiates a Jupyter Lab environment within the Docker container. The environment shares a folder named sharedFolder with the host system, ensuring seamless data integration and management.
